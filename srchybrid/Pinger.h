*
*  Some code in this file has been copied from a ping demo that was
*  created by Bob Quinn, 1997          http://www.sockets.com
*
* As some general documentation about how the ping is implemented,
* here is the description Bob Quinn wrote about the ping demo.
*
* Description:
*  Prototypes and typedefs Microsoft's ICMP.DLL functions & structs
*  for access to Internet Control Message Protocol.  This is capable
*  of doing "ping or "traceroute", although beware that Microsoft
*  discourages the use of these APIs.
*
* Some Background:
*
* The standard Berkeley Sockets SOCK_RAW socket type, is normally used
* to create ping (echo request/reply), and sometimes traceroute applications
* (the original traceroute application from Van Jacobson used UDP, rather
* than ICMP). Microsoft's WinSock version 2 implementations for NT4 and
* Windows 95 support raw sockets, but none of their WinSock version 1.1
* implementations (WFWG, NT3.x or standard Windows 95) did.
*
* Microsoft has their own API for an ICMP.DLL that their ping and tracert
* applications use (by the way, they are both non-GUI text-based console
* applications. This is a proprietary API, and all function calls that
* involve network functions operate in blocking mode. They still include
* it with WinSock 2 implementations.
*
* There is little documentation available (I first found it in the Win32
* SDK in \MSTOOLS\ICMP, and it exists on the MS Developers' Network
* CD-ROM now, also). Microsoft disclaims this API about as strongly as
* possible.  The README.TXT that accompanies it says:
*
* [DISCLAIMER]
*
* We have had requests in the past to expose the functions exported from
* icmp.dll. The files in this directory are provided for your convenience
* in building applications which make use of ICMPSendEcho(). Notice that
* the functions in icmp.dll are not considered part of the Win32 API and
* will not be supported in future releases. Once we have a more complete
* solution in the operating system, this DLL, and the functions it exports,
* will be dropped.
*
* [DOCUMENTATION]
*
* The ICMPSendEcho() function sends an ICMP echo request to the specified
* destination IP address and returns any replies received within the timeout
* specified. The API is synchronous, requiring the process to spawn a thread
* before calling the API to avoid blocking. An open IcmpHandle is required
* for the request to complete. IcmpCreateFile() and IcmpCloseHandle()
* functions are used to create and destroy the context handle.</P>

/* Note 1: The Reply Buffer will have an array of ICMP_ECHO_REPLY

* echo reply structure, plus 8 bytes for an ICMP header.

/* Note 2: For the most part, you can refer to RFC 791 for details
